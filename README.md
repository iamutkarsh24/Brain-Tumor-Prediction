## About the Project 🚀
This project aims to develop an automated brain tumor prediction system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyse MRI images. CNNs are a class of deep learning algorithms that have shown remarkable success in various image recognition and classification tasks. By leveraging the power of CNNs, this project seeks to improve the accuracy and efficiency of brain tumor detection, ultimately contributing to better patient care and outcomes.

## Objectives of the Project 🎯
- **Improvement of the Image Quality and Segmentation:** By applying the techniques like triangular fuzzy median and EfficientNet-B0 which improves the quality of MRI image. This helps us to filter the noise by reducing and preserving the edges.
- **Address Treatment Barrier:** Find the role of Bloor-brain barrier (BBB) and brain-tumor barrier (BTB) which prevent the delivery of the drug and explore the solution for this problem.

## Conclusion 🚀
This report presents the comparative analysis on the different type of brain simply tumour brain and healthy brain. Neuro Detect model use Convolutional Neural Network and achieved 98.7% accuracy in classification of MRI images into tumor and healthy brain. The model effectively extracted the key features from the scanned images and process through layers of CNN. There are two metrics F1-Score and accuracy which indicate the strong performance in classification of tumor brain and healthy brain, reducing the likelihood of false positive and negatives.
